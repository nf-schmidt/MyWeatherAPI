This is a simple ASP.NET Core Web API project that acts as a proxy for the Visual Crossing weather service. It demonstrates key backend development concepts including third-party API integration, caching, and secure key management.

Features:

Fetches real-time weather data for any city.

Uses an in-memory cache to reduce redundant API calls and improve performance.

Securely manages the external API key using the .NET Secret Manager.
